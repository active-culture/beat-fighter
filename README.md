Beat Fighter is a sequence-based fighting game pitting musicians and non-musicians alike against each other in ultimate combat. Each character is controlled by a different musical interface, which maps musical gestures to traditional fighting game mechanics and combos to create a musical duel experience. Using WebSockets and the Web Audio API, we aim to create a connected, modular system fully ensconced in the web.

> The overriding design goal for BeatFighter
> is to create a multiplayer experience that captures
> the feeling of the dying genre of split-screen games.
> In a world dominated by single players, lonely and wanting
> of an experience to connect them to their peers, in person,
> we seek to reconnect these old friends via music and the web.
